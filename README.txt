Please run this project from Main.py.

Please import all necessary modules:
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot

1. Initialise Element objects here with the desired properties,
2. Elements can be mounted to one another to allow interaction using the self.mount_top(object) or self.mount_bottom(object) methods.
3. The heat sink can be created using the HeatSink class to have the desired dimensions and properties however the heatsink is unable to interact with the other components in the current state of the code.
4. The max number of iterations run by the jacobi algorithm can be changed by varying the vairable max_iterations in main.py

Project structure:
Lib: All helper code files and class files can be found here.
Data: Data saved from running iterations of the code can be found here in CSV format.

An example of how this program should be setup to work can already be found in main.py feel free to use and edit this.
